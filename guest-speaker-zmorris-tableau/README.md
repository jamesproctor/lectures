### Resources

- [Tableau Viz Cookbook](https://public.tableau.com/profile/josh.weyburne?es_p=4730281#!/vizhome/CookBook/VizCookbook): Great for when you have data you aren’t sure how to best represent or if you want to learn how to make new chart types in Tableau

- [Tableau Chart Catalog](https://public.tableau.com/profile/kevin.flerlage#!/vizhome/TheTableauChartCatalog/TableauChartExamples): Another great example of charts you can make in Tableau

- [Makeover Monday](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/): Fantastic resource for datasets you can use to challenge your skills

- [Tableau Order of Operations](https://public.tableau.com/profile/merlijn.buit#!/vizhome/Workbook_42/OrderofOperations): Tableau has an order of operations that affects how visualizations are rendered. This is a very helpful visual to understand ‘what’s going on’ behind my viz if you need to troubleshoot.

- [Tableau Challenge Workbook](http://tableauchallenge.com/tableauchallenge/): A former Tableau Product Consultant put this together as a challenge workbook for users to test their skills and understanding.
