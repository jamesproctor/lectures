## Lesson Outline

> **Total Time: 240 mins**

**Day 1:**
I. Experimental Design slide deck

    1. Fixed vs. Random effects
    1. Several examples
    1. Randomness, and its play in causation vs. correlation
II. Random assignment notebook
    1. Given data, carry out common practice of randomly assigning experimental units into treatments

**Day 2:**
III. A/B Testing (slide deck)
    1. Recap of experimental design
    1. Recap of hypothesis testing
    1. Trout t-test example
    1. A new perspective: t-tests as a linear model
IV. The ANOVA test (mixed slide deck and notebook)
    1. The ANOVA test
    1. Reading an ANOVA table
    1. Multiple comparisons
    1. Complete two-way ANOVA test
