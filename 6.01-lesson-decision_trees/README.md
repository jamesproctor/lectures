## Learning Objectives

*After this lesson, students will be able to:*

- Understand the intuition behind decision trees.
- Calculate Gini.
- Describe how decision trees use gini to make decisions.
- Fit, generate predictions from, and evaluate decision tree models.
- Interpret and tune `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`, `min_samples_leaf`.
